A simple proof of concept Quaver Bot based upon a simple OOP memory access style.

## Credits
Crotchet uses the [MemoryLib](https://github.com/Sandwich-Group/MemoryLib) programmed by [HoLLy](https://github.com/Sandwich-Group) and published under the [Sandwich Group](https://github.com/Sandwich-Group), which is licensed under the MIT license.

I've slightly modified the library to work under Windows.
